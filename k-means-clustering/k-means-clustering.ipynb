    "# Using the SageMaker built-in K-Means algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker provides several built-in algorithms that you can use for a variety of problem types. These algorithms provide high-performance, scalable machine learning and are optimized for speed, scale, and accuracy. In this notebook, we will explore K-means, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering use cases. K-means finds k cluster centroids for a given set of records, such that all points within a cluster are closer in distance to their centroid than they are to any other centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SageMaker built-in K-means algorithm has many improvements over other state-of-the-art implementations, including (1) the ability to create good clusters with only a single pass over the dataset; (2) GPU support for blazing fast performance (e.g. train on ~37Gb of data in 7 minutes for about U.S. $1.00; (3) the ability to not only be faster, but also achieve the same accuracy as state-of-the-art multiple pass implementations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use this K-means algorithm on the GDELT dataset, https://registry.opendata.aws/gdelt, which monitors world news media across the world; data is stored for every second of every day. This information is freely available on Amazon S3 as part of the AWS Public Datasets program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**PREREQUISTES**:  be sure you are running this notebook with a MXNet kernel.  For example, in SageMaker Studio you could use a Python 3 (MXNet CPU Optimized) kernel, while for a SageMaker notebook instance, the conda_mxnet_p36 kernel can be used.\n",
