    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a relatively complete workflow to demonstrate not only Script Mode, but several other SageMaker features that are typically used in TensorFlow projects. The workflow includes prototyping with SageMaker's Local Mode training and inference features, and also showcases SageMaker's production-ready features for hosted training and inference. Automatic Model Tuning in SageMaker will be used to tune the model's hyperparameters.  Additionally, the [AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK](https://aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readmelink.html) will be used to automate the main training and deployment workflow for use in a production environment outside notebooks.    \n",

A convenient option is to use a SageMaker hosted endpoint, which serves real time predictions from the trained model (Batch Transform jobs also are available for asynchronous, offline predictions on large datasets). The endpoint will retrieve the TensorFlow SavedModel created during training and deploy it within a SageMaker TensorFlow Serving container. This all can be accomplished with one line of code.  \n",
