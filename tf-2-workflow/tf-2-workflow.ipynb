    "\n",
    "If you are using TensorFlow 2+ (or 1.x versions 1.11+), you can use Amazon SageMaker's prebuilt TensorFlow containers with TensorFlow training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker. This feature is named Script Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a relatively complete workflow to demonstrate not only Script Mode, but several other SageMaker features that are typically used in TensorFlow projects. The workflow includes prototyping with SageMaker's Local Mode training and inference features, and also showcases SageMaker's production-ready features for hosted training and inference. Additionally, Automatic Model Tuning in SageMaker will be used to tune the model's hyperparameters.  This workflow will be applied to a straightforward regression task, predicting house prices based on the well-known Boston Housing dataset. This public dataset contains 13 features regarding housing stock of towns in the Boston area.  Features include average number of rooms, accessibility to radial highways, adjacency to the Charles River, etc.  \n",
